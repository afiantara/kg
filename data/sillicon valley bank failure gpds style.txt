According to multiple news sources, Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by regulators on Friday due 
to liquidity problems and losses from bad loans. It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history 
and a major blow to the tech sector. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over the 
bank’s assets and deposits.
There are several factors that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank’s liquidity problems. Some of them 
are Higher interest rates that caused startups to withdraw deposits and struggle to repay loans, 
Losses from bad loans to unprofitable companies and fraud cases, A bank run that triggered a panic 
among customers and investors, and A failed attempt to raise capital from private equity firms.
Interest rates are higher in 2023 because of several reasons. Some of them are Persistent inflation 
that erodes the purchasing power of money, Strong economic growth that increases the demand for 
credit, The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark rate to combat inflation and prevent 
overheating.
Some of the fraud cases that Silicon Valley Bank was involved in are The Theranos scandal, where 
the bank lent $150 million to the blood-testing startup that turned out to be a fraud, The Wirecard 
debacle, where the bank lost $100 million from a German payment processor that collapsed amid 
accounting fraud, The Greensill Capital collapse, where the bank had exposure to $1.5 billion of 
loans backed by a supply-chain finance firm that went bankrupt.
Some of the factors that triggered a bank run on Silicon Valley Bank are Rumours of liquidity 
problems and losses from bad loans that spread on social media and online forums, A downgrade of 
the bank’s credit rating by Moody’s to junk status, A failed attempt to raise $10 billion from private 
equity firms that spooked investors and customers, A surge in withdrawals by startups and venture 
capitalists who feared losing their deposits.
Silicon Valley Bank tried to raise capital from private equity firms after it was threatened with a 
credit rating downgrade by Moody’s last week. The bank needed to raise at least $10 billion to meet 
its regulatory capital requirements and restore confidence. However, the bank failed to secure 
enough funding from potential investors, who were concerned about its liquidity problems and 
losses from bad loans. The bank only managed to raise $2.25 billion from a public offering and a 
private investment by General Atlantic but This was not enough to stop the bank run and prevent 
the regulators from shutting down the bank on Friday.
The failure of Silicon Valley Bank could have a significant impact on the tech industry and the 
economy. Some of the possible consequences are Hundreds of tech startups could lose access to 
their funds and face bankruptcy or layoffs, Venture capitalists and other investors could lose 
confidence in the tech sector and reduce their funding, The banking system could face a contagion 
risk as depositors and creditors lose trust in other banks, The Federal Reserve could face pressure to 
intervene and provide liquidity support to prevent a financial crisis.
There are several factors that contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Some of the main 
causes are The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates in December 2022, which increased 
the cost of borrowing and reduced the demand for loans, The bank’s exposure to risky loans and 
investments, especially in unprofitable tech startups and cryptocurrencies, The bank’s inability to 
raise enough capital from private equity firms and public markets to meet its regulatory 
requirements, The bank’s loss of confidence from depositors and creditors, who withdrew their 
money in masse after rumours of a credit rating downgrade.

The Fed’s policy on interest rates is uncertain at this point. Some possible scenarios are The Fed 
could raise interest rates further to combat inflation and prevent overheating of the economy, The 
Fed could cut interest rates to provide liquidity and stability to the banking system and avoid a 
contagion effect, The Fed could keep interest rates unchanged and use other tools such as 
quantitative easing or forward guidance to support the economy.
the Fed (Fed) should balance the trade-offs between inflation and growth and communicate clearly 
and transparently with the public and the markets.
According to news sources, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed on Friday after failing to raise enough 
capital to offset its losses and deposit outflows. SVB was one of the biggest lenders to tech start-ups 
and had a large exposure to long-term Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest 
rate hikes over the past year have caused the value of these bonds to plummet, resulting in huge 
losses for SVB.
The Federal Reserve has not commented on whether it will decline the interest rate hike due to 
SVB’s bankruptcy. However, some analysts believe that the Fed will continue its tightening policy as 
it prioritizes fighting inflation over supporting financial stability. Others argue that the Fed may 
pause or slow down its rate hikes as it assesses the impact of SVB’s failure on the broader economy 
and financial system.
According to some analysts, SVB’s (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse may cause a contagion effect for 
other regional banks in the US that have similar business models or exposures to long-term bonds. 
These banks may face higher funding costs, lower credit ratings, and deposit outflows as investors 
and customers lose confidence in their solvency.  However, experts also say that SVB’s failure is not 
a systemic risk to the entire financial system, as it is not too big or interconnected to cause a domino 
effect of defaults among other major banks or financial institutions. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has taken over SVB and will reimburse its insured 
depositors up to $250,000 per account2. The FDIC will also sell SVB’s assets and liabilities to another 
bank or entity that can continue its operations.
As for the impact on other countries, it may depend on how much exposure they have to SVB or its 
clients. Some foreign tech start-ups that relied on SVB for funding may face difficulties in accessing 
credit or capital markets3. Some foreign banks that had business relationships with SVB may also 
suffer losses or disruptions in their transactions3. However, these effects are likely to be limited and 
manageable, as most of SVB’s activities were concentrated in the US market. Some of them were 
both funding and loan clients of SVB. For example, Stripe received a $250 million credit line from SVB 
in 20191Coinbase also secured a $100 million loan from SVB in 20201Sunrun, a solar company, had a 
$200 million revolving credit facility with SVB that was due to mature in 2024.
SVB failure could have a major impact on other companies in several ways, such as Loss of deposits If 
they hold deposits with SVB, they could potentially lose their money above the insured limit of 
$250,000 per account. This could affect their cash flow and liquidity, Loss of credit If they rely on SVB 
for loans or credit lines, they could face difficulties in accessing funds or refinancing their debt. This 
could affect their growth and expansion plans, Loss of trust: If they are associated with SVB, they 
could face reputational damage or loss of confidence from their customers, investors, partners, or 
regulators. This could affect their valuation and market share.
These are some possible scenarios that could happen to SVB’s clients. However, some of them may 
have contingency plans or alternative sources of funding to mitigate the impact. For example, Stripe 
said it had sufficient cash reserves and other banking relationships to continue its operations Netflix 
and SpaceX also said they did not expect any material impact from SVB’s collapse. 
According to Fortune and Forbes, Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the country in 
terms of asset size before its collapse. It held $210 billion in assets, making it the second-largest 
bank failure in U.S. history, second only to Washington Mutual, whose 2008 failure came as the bank 
had roughly $300 billion in assets.
The failure of Silicon Valley Bank has caused some market jitters and worries, but analysts see only a 
limited risk of financial contagion. Experts say that SVB’s collapse is not a systemic risk to the entire 
financial system, but rather a specific case of mismanagement and interest-rate risk. SVB’s(Silicon 
Valley Bank) main customers were venture capital-backed companies, which are not as 
interconnected with other banks as traditional lenders2. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) also stepped in quickly to take control of SVB’s assets and prevent further losses.
According to multiple news sources, Elon Musk has expressed his interest in buying Silicon Valley 
Bank (SVB) after it collapsed due to a massive fraud scandal. He said he was “open to the idea” of 
turning it into a digital bank.
According to a regulatory filing by SVB Financial Group, the parent company of SVB, it recently 
discovered a potential fraud issue with a $70 million lending relationship. The borrower, a private 
equity manager named Elliot Smerling, allegedly used forged documents and fake companies to 
obtain loans from SVB and other banks. He also defaulted on his payments and fled the country. The 
fraud case triggered a series of investigations and lawsuits that revealed more problems with SVB’s 
financial reporting and risk management. The bank also suffered huge losses from its bond portfolio 
due to rising interest rates and market volatility. As a result, SVB’s stock price plummeted by 60% on 
Thursday, wiping out billions of dollars in market value. Many customers panicked and rushed to 
withdraw their deposits from SVB branches, causing long lines and chaos.  The situation was so dire 
that some analysts compared it to Enron, the infamous energy company that collapsed in 2001 after 
a massive accounting fraud scandal. According to various sources, Elliot Smerling cheated SVB by 
using a type of loan called a subscription credit facility, which is based on the pledges of investors to 
fund private equity funds. He claimed that he had raised millions of dollars from reputable investors 
for his funds and provided SVB with forged documents and bank statements to prove it. He also used 
fake companies and identities to create a web of deception. He then used the money he borrowed 
from SVB to fund his lavish lifestyle and personal expenses, such as buying luxury cars, jewellery, art, 
and real estate. He also failed to repay his loans on time and ignored SVB’s requests for information. 
When SVB tried to contact his investors directly, they either denied any involvement with him or did 
not exist at all. He eventually fled the country and was arrested by federal agents in Colombia. The 
exact amount of the fraud loss is not yet known, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions 
of dollars. SVB had lent Smerling more than $300 million based on his fraudulent claims and 
documents. However, some of that money may be recovered by seizing Smerling’s assets and suing 
his associates. The FDIC, which is responsible for paying back SVB’s insured depositors, said it 
expects to incur a loss of $2.5 billion from SVB’s failure.
According to the news reports, there is no evidence that any SVB (Silicon Valley bank) staff was 
directly involved in the fraud. However, some analysts and regulators have criticized SVB for its lack 
of oversight and due diligence in verifying Smerling’s credentials and documents. They also 
questioned SVB’s (Silicon Valley bank) internal controls and risk management practices, which failed 
to detect and prevent the fraud.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which took over SVB after its collapse, said it 
would conduct a thorough investigation into SVB’s operations and compliance. It also said it would 
hold accountable anyone who contributed to SVB’s failure or violated any laws or regulations.
bond price downfall and fraud scandal are both factors contributed to SVB’s failure, but the bond 
portfolio losses were more significant. SVB had a large bond portfolio of $21 billion, mostly 
consisting of long-term US Treasury bonds. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This means 
that SVB’s bonds lost value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates several times in 2023 to 
combat inflation.  SVB decided to sell its bond portfolio at a firesale price, generating a loss of $1.8 
billion. This severely damaged its balance sheet and capital position. It also eroded investor 
confidence and triggered a run on the bank. SVB tried to raise capital from investors but failed to 
secure enough funds to stay solvent. The fraud scandal was an additional blow that worsened SVB’s 
reputation and liquidity crisis.
A bank’s strategy depends on its specific situation and objectives, but generally speaking, a bank 
may adopt some of the following actions to cope with different scenarios, when interest rates rise, a 
bank may try to reduce its exposure to long-term fixed-rate assets, such as bonds, and increase its 
exposure to short-term variable-rate assets, such as loans. This way, the bank can benefit from 
higher interest income and lower interest expense. A bank may also try to hedge its interest rate risk 
by using derivatives such as swaps or futures. When exchange rates change, a bank may try to match 
its foreign currency assets and liabilities to avoid exchange rate risk. A bank may also try to hedge its 
exchange rate risk by using derivatives such as forwards or options. When stock prices fall, a bank 
may try to diversify its portfolio of equity investments and avoid holding too much of one stock or 
sector. A bank may also try to hedge its stock price risk by using derivatives such as futures or 
options.  When economic activities slow down, a bank may try to tighten its lending standards and 
monitor its credit quality more closely. A bank may also try to increase its capital and liquidity 
buffers to withstand potential losses and shocks.
SVB Financial Group, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which was taken over by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on March 10, 2023. This was the biggest banking 
failure since the 2008 global economic crisis, and it affected many startups and venture capitalists 
that relied on SVB for banking services.
According to news reports, SVB had done several things wrong that led to its downfall those are It 
had invested heavily in risky assets such as cryptocurrencies, biotech stocks, and leveraged loans 
that suffered huge losses when the market conditions turned unfavourable. It also engaged in 
complex derivatives transactions that amplified its exposure to market volatility, It had failed to 
maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers to withstand potential shocks and meet its 
obligations, It had also relied too much on short-term funding sources such as commercial paper and 
repurchase agreements that dried up when investors lost confidence in its solvency, It had 
concealed its true financial situation from regulators and investors by manipulating its accounting 
practices and misreporting its earnings. It had also violated several banking laws and regulations 
such as anti-money laundering rules, consumer protection rules, and capital adequacy rules.
The FDIC has appointed a receiver to manage SVB’s assets and liabilities and ensure an orderly 
resolution of the bank. The FDIC has also assured depositors that their money is safe and insured up 
to $250,000 per account.
SVB (Silicon Valley bank) had a large bond portfolio that suffered huge losses due to higher interest 
rates. According to news reports, SVB had a bond portfolio worth $21 billion that consisted mostly of 
long-term US Treasury bonds. These bonds pay a fixed interest rate and their value falls when 
market interest rates rise.
The Federal Reserve had been raising interest rates steadily since 2022 to combat inflation and cool 
down the overheated economy. This caused the market interest rates to increase and the bond 
prices to decrease. SVB’s bond portfolio lost about $1.8 billion in value because of this.
SVB decided to sell its entire bond portfolio at a loss on March 9, 2023, hoping to stop further losses 
and free up capital for other purposes. However, this moves backfired as it triggered a panic among 
investors and deposit.
